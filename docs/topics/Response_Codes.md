# Response/Error Codes

## HTTP Response/Error Codes

Our API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response/Error Code List

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 (OK) | The request completed successfully |
| 201 (CREATED) | The entity was created successfully |
| 204 (NO CONTENT) | The request completed successfully but returned no content |
| 304 (NOT MODIFIED) | The entity was not modified (no action was taken) |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST) | The request was improperly formatted, or the server couldn't understand it |
| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED) | The `Authorization` header was missing or invalid |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN) | The `Authorization` token you passed did not have permission to the resource |
| 404 (NOT FOUND) | The resource at the location specified doesn't exist |
| 405 (METHOD NOT ALLOWED) | The HTTP method used is not valid for the location specified |
| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS) | You've made too many requests, see [Rate Limits](#DOCS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits) |
| 502 (GATEWAY UNAVAILABLE) | There was not a gateway available to process your request. Wait a bit and retry |
| 5xx (SERVER ERROR) | The server had an error processing your request (these are rare) |

## JSON Error Response

Along with the HTTP error code, our API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string.
